"""Turns a raw `Observation` into the board *reading* a player actually
reasons with, for the LLM prompt (see prompt.py).

The engine hands a player 85 countries as two integers each. Everything
that actually decides a game of Twilight Struggle -- who Controls what,
which Battlegrounds are contested, what a region would score if its card
were played right now, how many Influence points a country still needs --
is a derivation off that raw table, and asking a model to redo those
derivations from a JSON dump on every single decision is where a
reviewed game went wrong: influence spread without ever crossing a
Control threshold, Battlegrounds abandoned the round after they were
taken, and Scoring cards played into regions the bot had never invested
in.

So this module computes them once, deterministically, from the same
public data the player is already entitled to (`Board` + `Observation`),
and renders them as text. Nothing here is a heuristic or a
recommendation -- every number is a fact the rules define and a human
player reads straight off the board.
