"""The rules engine: the pending-decision-stack state machine and the
public API contract from docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (`Engine`, plus the
dataclasses/enums a caller needs: `Side`, `DecisionKind`, `Action`, `Decision`,
`Observation`). Board/card/event internals live in their own submodules
(`.board`, `.cards`, `.events`, `.replay`, `.rules`) and are reached
directly by anything that needs them.
